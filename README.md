# clas12-env

### Overview
This repository is the environment setup for the non-GEANT portion of CLAS12 software builds.  It leverages modulefiles's prerequisites and conflicts to help ensure a working environment with easy and flexible manipulations.

### In Use
The main branch is deployed on CVMFS and used for running software at JLab, on the Open Science Grid, or on any supported operating system with CVMFS access:

`/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.jlab.org/jlab/hallb/clas12/sw`

The documentation for just using these environment modules has so far been [maintained at this wiki](https://clasweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/CLAS12_Software_Environment_@_JLab).

### Special Modules
These two modules are required by many other modules to provide some 3rd-patry dependencies.  No automated recipe currently exists for these installations, but they required only very standard build and/or install procedures with no patching.
* system
  * sets `OSRELEASE` based on the operating system
  * sets `CLAS12_HOME` (only for convenience)
  * sets `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` for these C++ libraries:
    * [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
    * [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
* pymods
  * sets `PYTHONPATH` to pickup pip-installed python packages:
    * sqlalchemy
    * pymysql
    * ninja
    * jinja
    * meson
    * tzdata
    * numpy
    * pandas
    * (and their dependencies)
