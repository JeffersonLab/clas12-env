# clas12-env

### Overview
This repository is the environment setup for CLAS12 software.  It leverages modulefiles's prerequisites and conflicts to help ensure a working environment with easy and flexible manipulations.  

*Note, the modulefiles and software builds for GEANT4/GEMC used in this environment are [documented separately](https://geant4.jlab.org/node/1) and can be used independently.*

### In Use
The main branch is deployed on CVMFS and used for running software at JLab, on the Open Science Grid, or on any supported operating system with CVMFS access.  The entry point is:

`module use /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.jlab.org/jlab/hallb/clas12/sw/modulefiles`

The documentation for just using these environment modules has so far been [maintained at this wiki](https://clasweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/CLAS12_Software_Environment_@_JLab).

### Special Modules
Most modules here just update one's environment for a single, particular software package, by adding that package's directory to some runtime executable/library search paths.  The modules below are a bit different.  Remember that `module show` will print what a given module will do to your environment.
* clas12
  * loads a bunch of other modules to provide a full CLAS12 environment in one shot
* geant4
  * adds the [independent geant4-related modulefiles](https://geant4.jlab.org/node/1), e.g. gemc, to the search path
* tmpfs
  * sets various envionment variables to get various software (maven, apptainer, java, things that honor `TMPDIR`, etc.) to use a `/tmp` alternative, e.g. for when it's mounted noexec

Also, these two modules below are required by many other modules to provide some 3rd-party dependencies.  While no automated recipe currently exists for installation of those dependencies, they require only very standard build and install procedures with no patching.
* system
  * sets `OSRELEASE` based on the operating system (via [this script](util/osrelease.py))
  * sets `CLAS12_HOME` (only for convenience)
  * sets `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` for these C++ libraries:
    * [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
    * [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
* pymods
  * sets `PYTHONPATH` to pickup these pip-installed python packages (and their dependencies):
    * sqlalchemy
    * pymysql
    * ninja
    * jinja
    * meson
    * tzdata
    * numpy
    * pandas
